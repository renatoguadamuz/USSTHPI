# USSTHPI (US House Pricing Index)

This brief project applies a double-RSI crossover method to determine buying and selling long-term opportunities for the US housing market.

The housing market has experienced continuous growth for over a decade and many analysts have warned about a possible Real Estate bubble underway.

However, these warnings have been ringing for at least a few years without consolidation.

I am fascinated by the uncertainty and excitement that predicting time series can provide. I am particularly interested in finance and stock markets.

I developed a reliable and extremely simple stock technical analysis tool for entry and exit positions, I called it Double-RSI crossover. In simple terms, it consists of a fast and a slow relative strength index (RSI) that indicates buying and selling opportunities based directly on price action. Its core spirit is similar to a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) momentum indicator. It gets more sophisticated than that but, for the interests of this project, it can be applied assuming the House Price Index (HPI) as the close value of price action for each month or trimester. If you are interested in the Double-RSI crossover you can find more information [here].

The results are surprisingly useful and help to plan to enter or expand the Real Estate opportunities or differ this decision for more favorable conditions. The HPI is rich in historical data, allowing us to study previous housing market crashes and evidence of why calling a housing market crash two or three years ago was poorly justified.

The data is provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis [(FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSTHPI) based on the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency.
