# USSTHPI (US House Pricing Index)

This brief project applies a method called double-RSI crossover to determine buying and selling long-term opportunies for the US housing market.

The housing market has experiences continuous growth for over a decade and many analysts have warne about a possible Real Estate bubble underway.

However, these warnings have been ringing for at least a couple of years without consolidation.

I am fascinated by the uncertainty and exciment that predinting time series can provide. I am particularly interested in finance and stock markets.

I developed a realible and extremly simple stock technical analysis tool to entry and exit position, I called it Double-RSI crossover. In simple terms, it consists of a fast and a slow relative strenght index (RSI) that indicate buying and selling opportunities based directly on price action. In its core spirit, it is similar to a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) momentum indicator. It gets more sophisticated than that but, for the interests of this project, it can be applied assuming the House Price Index (HPI) as the close value of price action for each month or trimester. If you are interested in the Double-RSI crossover you can find more information [here].

The results are surpringly useful and help to plan in advance to enter or expand the Real Estate opportunities or differ this decision for more favorable conditions. The HPI is rich in historical data, allowing to study previous house market crashes and evidence why calling a housing market crash two or three years ago was poorly justified.
